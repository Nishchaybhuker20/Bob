# Description of What we have Build 👩‍💻👨‍💻
- Through our project, we have tried to take the experience of BOB Customer’s close to the perfection.
- We have a designed and developed a more interactive user interface for the users.
- We have also taken measures that making the experience better should not impact the user’s privacy.

# Solution Diagram🧪
Here we are taking a situation :

- 1st User : **Rahul Singh**
- 2nd User:  **Sita Singh**

Rahul wants to send Rs.10000 to his mother for some financial help. Rahul is working in an IT company as a Senior Developer. He always remains occupied with projects. After an update in the app, he doesn’t know where is the transaction


# Techstacks used including the API 
- We wanted to bring such a solution which will help both BOB and BOB cutomers by using Flutter as our techstack.
- To make the user interaface more interactive for the user we have used LottieFiles and Rive.
- Azure is used for text to speech .going to use for hosting ans storage will be present over here.
Firebase is only used for authentication.
- We build API from scratch.


# ML Model used


# Prototype of the app📱


# Test Cases📃


# Why our solution should be considered😎
Following are few reasons due to which we think our solution should be considered:
- Through our solution disabled person will also be able to use the BOB app without using someone’s help.
- Now users don’t have to go through the time wasting process of calling the customer help centre or visit nearby bank for any queries.
- Just by tapping on a button , an interactive virtual assistant will come in front of the user to help them out.
- Vaahini is going to interact with their customer’s in English, Hindi and all the regional language as well. This will help the BOB app to reach the rural parts of India.


# Ability to scale up
- Flutter is the main techstack of this entire project . This gives us the flexiblity to use the same codebase for web,android and iOS.
- This will help in reducing the cost of development of the project which will be the best budget approach .


# Things we are going to bring in the future version🪄🔜
- In the upcoming version of this project,  we are going to bring automation in the app which will help the user to complete a particular process just by giving a command and Vaahini will complete most of the process by herself.
- We have a designed and developed a more interactive user interface for the users. And when we are talking about experience , how great it will be if all this work can be done by certain some without bringing danger to a user’s privacy.
